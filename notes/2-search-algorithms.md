# üöÄ Search Algorithms 

## Introduction to Search Problems
- **Search algorithms** ‚Üí  Used when an agent needs to find a sequence of actions that **leads to a goal**
  - These algorithms help **navigate problem spaces** efficiently
    
<br>

- **Complete Search Algorithm** ‚Üí An algorithm that finds the destination if it exists and notifies the caller if the destination doesn't exist

## Components of a Search Problem
1. **Initial State** ‚Üí The starting point of the agent.
2. **Actions** ‚Üí All possible actions the agent can take.
3. **Transition Model** ‚Üí A description of how each action changes the state.
4. **Goal Test** ‚Üí Determines if the current state is the goal.
5. **Path Cost** ‚Üí The numerical cost of a path from the start to a goal.

## Time & Space Complexity ‚è≥üíæ
**Time Complexity**  ‚Üí Measures how the **running time of an algorithm** increases as the input size grows
- A loop running through **n** elements has **O(n) time complexity**
  
<br>

**Space Complexity** ‚Üí Measures the **amount of memory** an algorithm uses in relation to input size
- A recursive function storing **n** recursive calls has **O(n) space complexity**

## Types of Search Algorithms
Search algorithms are categorized into two types:

### **Uninformed Search (Blind Search)**
- No additional information about the goal except how to determine if a state is a goal
- Example algorithms:
    - **[Breadth-First Search (BFS)](https://github.com/Minko82/learning-ai/blob/main/notes/3-breadth-first-search.md)**
    - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
    - **Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)**

### **Informed Search (Heuristic Search)**
- Uses heuristics to estimate the cost to the goal, making search more efficient
  
- Example algorithms:
  - **Greedy Best-First Search**
  - A* **Search**
