# 📜 Intelligent Agents & Environments

## **Agents**
**Agent** → Any entity that **perceives its environment** and **acts upon it** to achieve a goal.

>**Formula:**
> $\text{Agent} = \text{Percepts} + \text{Actions}$

<br>

---

## Percepts 
- **Percept** → The input data that an agent receives from its environment.
  - Example: A self-driving car perceives `lane markings`, `traffic lights`, and `nearby vehicles`
    
<br>

- **Percept Sequence** → The **history** of all percepts the agent has received.  

<br>

---

## Agent Function
**Agent function** → a mapping from **percept sequences** to **actions**:
- Example:  A `self-driving car` (Agent) receives a `traffic light is red` (Percept). The function decides to `brake` (Action)

>**Formula:**
> $f: P^* \rightarrow A$
> <br>
> <br>
> Where:
> - $P^*$  = All possible percept sequences
> - $A$ = Set of all possible actions


<br>

## Agent Program
**Agent program** → the actual **implementation** of the agent function in **code**.

- Example: A `thermostat` can be implemented as:

    ```python
    # Simple reflex agent for a thermostat
    def thermostat(percept):
        if percept == "Too Hot":
            return "Turn AC On"
        elif percept == "Too Cold":
            return "Turn Heater On"
        else:
            return "Do Nothing"
    ```

<br>

## Rationality & Performance Measures
- **Rationality** → Choosing the action that **maximizes expected success**
- **Performance Measure** → Defines **what is "good" behavior**
    - Example: For a `chess bot`, `winning` is good, `losing` is bad.
      
<br>

> ### 📌 **NOTE**
>  An agent **must** have a performance measure to be considered rational!  

---



<br>


### 🛠 **Rationality is based on P.E.A.S.**  
- **P**:Performance
- **E**:Environment
- **A**:Actuator
- **S**:Sensor
  
> **Formula:**  
> $$\text{Agent} = \text{Performance} + \text{Environment} + \text{Actuator} + \text{Sensors}$$  



  - **Example:**  

| Agent Type | Performance Measure | Environment | Actuators | Sensors |
|------------|----------------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Taxi Driver** | Safe, fast, legal, comfortable trip, maximize profit | Roads, traffic, pedestrians, customers | Steering, accelerator, brake, signal, horn, display | Cameras, sonar, speedometer, GPS, odometer, accelerometer, engine sensors, keyboard |



<br>

---

## Task Environments
- **Task environment** → the "problems" that rational agents are the "solution"

- **Environment** → **everything an agent interacts with**.

<br>

### **Properties of Environments:**

**Observability**
| Property | Meaning |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Fully Observable** | Agent has complete knowledge of the world |
| **Partially Observable** | Agent only has limited information |
| **Unobservable** | Agent has no direct perception of the environment |

<br>

**Determinism vs. Stochasticity**
| Property | Meaning | Example |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Deterministic** | Next state is fully determined by actions | Calculator |
| **Stochastic** | Actions have uncertainty | Weather forecast |

<br>

**Discrete vs. Continuous**
| Property | Meaning |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Discrete** | The agent has finitely many distinct actions |
| **Continuous** | The agent has infinitely many possible actions |

<br>

**Benign vs. Adversarial**
| Property | Meaning |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Benign** | There is no opposing agent working against the system |
| **Adversarial** | The environment includes agents with conflicting objectives |

<br>

**Single Agent vs. Multi-Agent**
| Property | Meaning |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Single Agent** | Only one agent is operating in the environment |
| **Multi-Agent** | Multiple agents interact, possibly cooperatively or competitively |

<br>

**Episodic vs. Sequential**
| Property | Meaning | Example |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Episodic** | Decisions don’t affect future percepts | Image classification |
| **Sequential** | Past decisions impact the future | Chess, driving |

<br>

**Static vs. Dynamic**
| Property | Meaning | Example |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Static** | The environment doesn’t change while deciding | Sudoku |
| **Dynamic** | The world keeps changing | Self-driving cars |
